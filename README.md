# Seed Germination Prediction Using Phylogenetic Conservatism
 
## Project Goal
* Quantify phylogenetic conservatism variation (phylogenetic signal) in seed morphological traits and seed germination rate
* Compare seed germination prediction model with and without phylogentic ingradients in seed germination rate prediction model

## Data 

### Mophological measurements
* Seed morphological traits were measured through 3D photo image device.

### Germination rate
* Seed germination rate data were colleted from previous publications as well as germination experiment in the lab.

### Phylogenetic tree
* The phylogenetic tree for this study was generated by pruning previously published synthesized tree (Zane et al. 2013). Missing species were replace the species within the same genus to get relative locations. 

Data is stored in the input folder.
